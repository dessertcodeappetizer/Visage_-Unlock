Face recognition and identification program

It is basic face recognition and identification software that I have developed using OpenCV and python programming in real-time. It can be used as an identification tool for your household camera surveillance system. Just take your face in front of the camera and you will be recognised. The name will be displayed on the top of the face. If the wrong person tries to make an attempt he/she will be recognised as an intruder and "Locked" will be displayed on the screen. This is a highly efficient system, working in the realtime scenario.  

Please install libraries like OpenCV, NumPy and Python3.
Take some of your pictures which acts like a database for the comparison of the image in front of camera.
Run the cmd on the terminal and it should work as its name suggests.
